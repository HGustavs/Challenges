A minimal particle based verlet physics engine using html5 canvas for rectangular objects consisting of four points and represented using four triangles. The four points are recomputed from velocity and angle each frame. After that the points are updated using gravity and constraints for penetrating into adjacent triangles. From the adjusted points the velocity and angular velocity for the rectangle is updated. 
    Creating a minimal Verlet-based physics engine for rectangles using HTML5 canvas, with rectangular objects represented using four points and four triangles, involves several key components:
        Verlet integration for point motion
        Rectangular objects made of 4 points
        Gravity and collision constraints
        Triangle-based collision detection
        Updating velocity and angular velocity from adjusted positions

The square must retain its initial shape every frame update and no point may pass outside the canvas boundaries.
    To enforce that:
        The square retains its initial shape exactly (i.e., all edge lengths and angles remain constant).
        No point may pass outside the canvas boundaries.
    We need to:
        Keep the four corners constrained as a rigid body using rigid body dynamics principles, not soft constraint corrections.
        After integrating motion, project the rigid body (rectangle) based on its center position and orientation.
        Clamp each point inside the canvas bounds.
        Update the rectangle’s velocity and angular velocity from how much the center and angle changed.

The rectangle currently does not rotate correctly when one corner crosses the boundary of the canvas.
    Goal:
        Ensure the rectangle rotates correctly while constraining each corner inside the canvas, without deforming the shape.
    We need to:
        Simulate velocity & angular velocity via Verlet (from position/angle delta).
        Update center and rotation as usual.
        Recalculate corners based on rigid transformation.
        Iteratively project the rigid body inside canvas bounds using minimal translation and angle adjustment without breaking rigidity.

The rectangle is overcorrecting and rotating violently. We want the angle adjustments to be less violent and achieve rest after angular correction.
    Goal:
        Keep the rectangle fully within bounds, even after rotation.
        Preserve rigidity (no distortion).
        Reduce angle corrections smoothly, allowing the object to settle naturally.
    Key Changes:
        Clamp corners by nudging center only, not angle directly.
        Dampen angular velocity smoothly, rather than forcibly reducing angle.
        Estimate angular velocity from angle difference and apply friction.
        Avoid directly subtracting from angle in the correction loop — instead use physical damping over time.

Now we are back to the same condition where the rectangle is resting on one corner and not rotating to come to rest.
    When a corner hits a wall, generate torque to rotate the rectangle into a more stable (resting) position — without deforming the shape and without violent reactions.
    Solution: Torque From Collision Impulses
    We'll:
        Detect how much each corner penetrates the boundary.
        Compute a reaction force at the corner (to push it inside).
        Apply this force to:
            Translate the center (linear velocity).
            Add angular velocity, based on the lever arm from center to corner.
    This mimics a proper reaction torque and naturally allows the rectangle to rotate and settle.

The rectangle is rotating violently. Make 10 rectangles and add penetration handling for each of the four triangles composing other rectangles.
    Here’s a complete implementation of a minimal 2D Verlet-based physics engine with:
        rectangles (rigid, rotating)
        Each rectangle made of 4 triangles (for accurate collision)
        Penetration handling across all triangle edges
        Controlled rotation damping (no violent spinning)
        Full canvas boundary constraint

Add each additional rectangle after 30 frames to reduce overlap of rectangles
    To stagger the addition of rectangles (1 every 30 frames), we can:
        Initialize an empty array of rectangles.
        Use a frameCount to track frames.
        Add a new rectangle every 30 frames until all 10 are added.

The rectangles are regularly overlapping. Make use of triangle intersection constraints to make sure that the rectangles do not overlap
    To prevent rectangle overlap reliably, we’ll use triangle intersection constraints between all triangles from different rectangles. When overlap is detected, we’ll:
        Compute the Minimum Translation Vector (MTV) to resolve the overlap.
        Apply displacement and torque to both rectangles in opposite directions using the MTV.
        Iterate constraints multiple times for stability.

The overlapping problem has been solved expertly, but the rectangles are over compensating and spinning wildly. Suggest and approach to reduce the energy in the corrections. Visualize triangle outlines/debug vectors
    You're absolutely right: while the triangle collision constraints prevent overlapping effectively, they introduce high corrective energy, which leads to:
        Overcompensation
        Wild spinning or jitter
        Energetically "exploding" simulations

This is slightly better but the correction is still far too large and now the rectangles are not rotating correctly when crossing the canvas boundaries.
    1. Apply Correction Per-Point, Not Just to Center
    Instead of adjusting the center, check and apply constraints on each corner of the rectangle — similar to standard Verlet stick constraints:
        If a corner is out of bounds, push it back in
        Adjust center and angle based on that correction
    This allows proper rotational feedback during wall contact.
    2. Reduce Correction Energy Gradually
    Rather than a constant damping factor, apply:
        Smaller impulses per iteration
        A smooth falloff using a decay curve (e.g. quadratic or sigmoid)
    This avoids oscillation or violent spin-up from constraint corrections.

The rectangles are now rotating correctly but the corrections are still too large, and increasing when new rectangles are added. Can sorting the collisions and constraint resolutions vertically be helpful?
    When many rectangles are added, deep overlaps occur — especially in lower rectangles that now have to resolve against many others on top of them. Since constraint resolution is order-sensitive, this leads to:
        Large corrections being compounded
        Unstable torques and jitter
        Rectangles “exploding” or “spinning up” on contact

The compensation energies are still too large. Can adding support for rest and friction help with the overcorrections?

The complete code has been added and cleaned up with all the new features:
    Rest detection
    Friction
    Collision wake-up
    Impulse damping

Stacking does not work, and perhaps we need to add more iterations to reduce the energy in the system. Also, add visual indication for rotation.
    Increased Iterations	resolveCollisions() now runs with more iterations (e.g. 10) to reduce residual energy and improve stacking stability
    Rotation Visualization	Each rectangle now shows a directional arrow indicating current rotation direction and magnitude
    Maintains	SAT collision, debug MTV lines, and triangle subdivision

Stacking injects too much energy. When two rectangles penetrate even at a very shallow depth, the energy added makes the rectangle jump very far. We need it to just be pushed out and not add to the velocity of the rectangle.
    Apply Position Corrections Without Velocity Changes
    Position-only corrections should not influence the rectangle's velocity or angular velocity directly.
    Separate Collision Response and Velocity Update
    Resolve collisions purely via positional separation, and let the next velocity step reflect any movement naturally.
    Limit MTV (Minimum Translation Vector) Magnitude
    Cap the MTV length to prevent large corrections due to deep or sudden overlaps.
    Scale MTV Based on Penetration Depth (Non-linear decay)
    Use a smoother falloff for MTV adjustment like scale = min(1, penetration / maxDepth), to avoid overcompensation.

The penetrations now work but when the falling recangles hit the stationary recangles the energies are too large. Also, the rectangles do not rotate when hitting the borders of the canvas.
    Scaling MTV corrections based on relative velocity — slower falls → smaller correction steps.
    Applying friction at contact point — so objects don't slide or bounce off easily.
    Introduce a positional damping factor (even for shallow contacts).

Add point based friction,  torque distribution and moment of inertia simulation. Also improve handling of polygon penetration which still results in considerable penetration between rectangles.
    Point-based friction: Tangential damping at contact points.
    Torque distribution: Angular velocity updates using torque and moment of inertia.
    Moment of inertia: Realistic angular response based on rectangle size.
    Improved polygon penetration handling: More stable with less jitter and overcorrection.

Integrate vertical sorting and suggestions above for increased stacking stability.
    Vertical sorting before resolving collisions.
    Scaled MTV: only apply a portion of the MTV to reduce overcorrection.
    Increased solver iterations: from 8 → 15.
    Correction bias: resting rectangles move less.
    Angular/linear velocity clamping to prevent explosions.
    Improved friction: tangential friction with basic static friction threshold.
    Upward bias in MTV correction to reduce compounding jitter in stacked objects.

Rectangle to rectangle penetrations still introduce too much energy into the falling rectangles
    MTV resolution uses position-only correction — avoids injecting velocity.
    Effective mass weighting — sleeping or resting bodies move less.
    Increased friction stability — especially for tangential jitter.
    Angular and linear velocity clamping retained.
    Upward bias + shallow MTV correction damping.
    Increased rest detection sensitivity.
