As reported on the Creative Applications Network, Matthias broke down the process of drawing into steps for the JavaScript-based algorithm to follow:

1. draw head shape
2. draw fold inside the head shape
3. find shape center, draw nose
4. draw eyes based on the nose position and radius to make sure that they don’t overlap
5. draw eyebrows based on the eye positions and radii
6. draw mouth based on eyes and nose to make sure they don’t overlap
7. draw cheeks based on head outline and head radius
8. draw ears on the head outline
9. draw hair on the head outline

Matthias also states that his motive was to “create something procedural that has a truly individual artistic touch to it and is not instantly recognizable as a generative art piece.”

A montage of scribbly cartoon faces, each conveying with distinct personality, would make any parent proud of their child’s artistic creation…except a child didn’t produce these faces; a computer algorithm did.

Meet the randomly-generated caricatures that are part of the Weird Faces Study, the product of a computer algorithm developed by media artist Matthias Dörfelt. Having an interest in both illustration and coding, Matthias designed the algorithm to follow a systematic order for constructing a cartoon face, even adding in noise to the shape of the hand to illicit a sense of a hand drawn face. Surprisingly, each face is not only recognizable, but has human qualities captured in the rudimentary sketches.

Describing the project on his website, Matthias writes that, “Even though the faces look hand-drawn, they are entirely expressed by algorithmic rules. Each face is random, each face is unique. Still, they look similar to my actual hand drawn faces.” As you can see from his journal, this isn’t an overstatement.
